      The food options and responsibilities to consider, canteens must be better organised and more efficient than they have been in the past.Online menus with photographs of the
      meals prepared, and detailed description of their ingredients help both students and parents make the right nutritional choices. Each student or staff member who accesses the canteen could be provided with a school canteen account
      on the school website that keeps track of their previous meal choices and any dietary requirements they may have. ordering online by ticking a box and paying for meals online can eliminate 
      all the fuss of money handling , making it safer and less complicated for staff and students alike. Here again, diversity is the key.

      <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">
      Implemented Online Attendance Management System: This informs parents about their children's activities in the school instantly.
      Once a student reaches the school, the parents will be informed about the status via text messages. This helps schools keep a record of the students' absenteeism.
      Students can mark the attendance by logging in, and this is stored in a database, which can later be checked by the admin. The tracker has so much potential
      that it can identify the students who are irregular to their classes and not ready to establish connectivity with the actual concepts of their curriculum's subjects.
      As soon as the you enter the students' enrollment number or name, details like the availability in classes, number of lectures attended 
      will be displayed and no proxies are possible since the tracker is supported by cloud capabilities. Even the security offered can be so robust 
      and powerful that those students who always fool their deans are caught in a shorter span - just after the admin enters the login details into 
      this tracker. All this will improve accuracy and transparency in any of the educational institutions as students and their parents are pre-informed 
      about the real-time status of leave requests and absenteeism in a confidential manner and at reduced costs.
